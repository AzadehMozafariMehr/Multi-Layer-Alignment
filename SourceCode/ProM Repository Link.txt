We implemented the approach as a package named "MultiLayerAlignment" in the ProM framework.
You can find the package in this link: https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/Packages/
The source code required to reproduce the experiment can be found in this link: https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/Packages/MultiLayerAlignment/Tags/Version1  
You can find an example of each input in the folder of Experiment0. 
Replace the patch of your inputs in the main class of the plugin named "MultiLayerAlignment".
Run the program directly from the main class.
